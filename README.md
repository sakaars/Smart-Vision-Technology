# Smart-Vision-Technology
CNN-based model for automated brand recognition from product images. It accurately classifies brands and uses OCR to extract product details like MRP and expiry dates.

#Objectives:-

Brand Recognition: Accurately classify product images into corresponding brands.
Automation: Simplify the process of identifying product brands by eliminating the need for manual input.
Efficiency: Build a scalable solution that can handle large datasets and produce real-time predictions.
Preprocessing for OCR: Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) as a supplementary technique to extract product details like MRP, manufacturing, and expiry dates.

#Methodology:-

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

We used datasets containing images of products categorized by brands.
Data augmentation techniques like rescaling, flipping, and zooming were applied using ImageDataGenerator to increase dataset variability and improve the model's generalization ability.

Model Architecture:

A custom CNN model was designed with multiple convolutional layers to extract key features from the images.
The model architecture includes three convolutional layers, each followed by max pooling to down-sample the image and reduce computational complexity.
The final layers include fully connected Dense layers with Dropout to prevent overfitting.
The output layer uses a softmax activation function to handle multi-class classification, with each class representing a different brand.

Training and Validation:

The dataset was split into training and validation sets, with an 80-20 split.
The model was trained for 10 epochs using Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.
The performance was tracked by validation accuracy and loss, with validation accuracy reaching high performance over the training iterations.

OCR Integration:

For additional product information extraction, Tesseract OCR was used to extract text from product labels.
The text extraction was enhanced by preprocessing images with techniques like grayscale conversion and thresholding.

Prediction:

The model was tested with new images that were uploaded, preprocessed, and then passed through the trained CNN model for brand recognition.
Predictions were made with high accuracy, and the system could correctly classify the product brand from the image.

#Results:-

Accuracy: The model achieved a high validation accuracy of over 90%, demonstrating its ability to distinguish between different product brands.
Freshness Detection: An additional module was developed to detect product freshness using a heuristic based on image brightness, which provided insights into the visual state of fresh produce.
Text Extraction: OCR successfully extracted key product details, including brand name, pack size, MRP, and expiry dates, with a reasonable accuracy after image preprocessing.
